I have a TAM card, and extensive event experience including working with Southern Wine & Spirits pouring at the Keep Memory Alive Gala for the past three years since coming to Las Vegas.

    I have a TAM card and experience pouring and educating in Vegas.
    I can research and remember the details of the products you need to sell before the event.
    I am extremely reliable, on-time, and professional with well kept long hair. I can shave my beard if you like.
    I am well-spoken, friendly, and outgoing.
    I have reliable transportation, do professional photography, and have a Galaxy S7 (good phone camera).
    I can SELL, SELL, SELL a good product!!!
