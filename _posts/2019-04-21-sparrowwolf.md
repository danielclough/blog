> **Steak Tartar**: 
> [The idea of eating minced and/or raw meat was popularized in Slavic regions, associated with Mongol encroachment. They and their turkic allies the Tatars were known collectively as being from Tartary, which was essentially Mongolia, though the name was a conflation of Tatar with the Greek stories of Tartarus. They had a tradition of finely mincing very tough meats like horse and camel, to make them edible, then binding the meat with milk or eggs. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak_tartare)

If you value meat as an artistic endeavor you have to try it. 
It's figuratively _alive_ with flavor and texture.

The Music was excellent.

Diego played passionately to a mellow soundtrack.

I felt awkward pulling out my light to take the picture. Without a tripod, and without my beloved D750 - I just can't pump the ISO for a decent shot, so I pulled out my "like wow" bright light. I got the light after talking with John Curtas about the need for good light, he uses a very nice selfie ring, which is small and curious compared to my massive portable studio light. I don't know nearly as much about food as he does, so I'm leaning on the value of good photography, and Wikipedia.

I'm not really a pork lover, but the **Pig Wings** was new and interesting to me. It's a _Pork Shank_, the bottom part of a pig leg, prepared like fried chicken. It's the It's pork without a fork! 

Pig legs are lean and muscular, and the shank is pretty distinct from the ham. I'm surprised it's mot more popular. 

Joey Sanders sang and played beautifully.

That's about it - and also - in case you didn't know... there is no Easter Bunny and Jesus rising from the dead is a metaphor.
